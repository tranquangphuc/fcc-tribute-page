          The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the
          greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which it is
          any where directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the
          division of labour.

          Profile of Adam Smith. The original depiction of Smith was created in
          1787 by James Tassie in the form of an enamel paste medallion. Smith
          did not usually sit for his portrait, so a considerable number of
          engravings and busts of Smith were made not from observation but from
          the same enamel medallion produced by Tassie, an artist who could
          convince Smith to sit.

        <p>
          With The Wealth of Nations Adam Smith installed himself as the leading
          expositor of economic thought. Currents of Adam Smith run through the
          works published by David Ricardo and Karl Marx in the nineteenth
          century, and by John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman in the
          twentieth.
